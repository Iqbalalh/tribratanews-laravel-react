In this project, we develop a news portal website inspired by the Tribrata News platform "https://tribratanews.polri.go.id", for the Lampung Regional Police (Polda Lampung). We utilize Laravel 10 as the backend, ReactJS as the frontend, and PostgreSQL as the database. On the client side, we develop several features, including the landing page, latest updates from Lampung Regional Police's social media, categorized news pages, and pages for reading selected news articles. Meanwhile, for the admin or news editor side, we create an analytical dashboard for published news and CRUD functionalities for news creation.
